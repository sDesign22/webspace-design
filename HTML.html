    <p>HTML is the World Wide Web's core (standard) markup language for creating Web pages, it describes the structure of a Web page and consists of a series of elements.
        HTML was primarily designed as a language for semantically describing scientific documents.
        Its design has enabled it to be adapted over subsequent years, to describe a number of other types of documents and even applications.
        These definitions allow HTML processors (such as <i>web browsers or search engines</i>), to present and use documents or applications in a wide variety of contexts.
        For example, Search engines can use headings, to effectively index a page or provide links to subsections of the page from results.
        <br/>HTML <strong>Elements</strong> tell the browser how to display content, and label content using <em>start and end tags</em>:
        <code><b> &lt;Start-Tag> <em>Content is everything inside of the start and end tags.</em> &lt;/End-Tag> </b></code>
        <br/>Some Elements are Empty Elements and do not have an End Tag: <code><b> &lt;Empty-Element> </b></code>
        <br/>HTML documents might be rendered to a <i>screen, through a speech synthesizer or on a braille display</i>.
        To influence exactly how such rendering takes place, authors can also use a styling language such as <strong>CSS</strong>.
    </p>

  <section> <h2>HTML Editors</h2>
    <p>A text editor is all you need to learn HTML!
      Web pages can be created and modified using professional HTML editors, however for learning;
      it's recommend to use a simple text editor like <i>Notepad (PC) or TextEdit (Mac)</i>.
    </p>

     <label for="sample_html" id="sample_html"> A basic HTML document looks like this: </label>
     <br/>  <textarea name="sample_html" rows="14" cols="100">
&lt;!DOCTYPE html>
&lt;html lang ="en">
  &lt;head>
    &lt;title>Sample page&lt;/title>
  &lt;/head>
 &lt;body>
  &lt;h1>A Sample HTML Page!&lt;/h1>
    &lt;p>This is a paragraph in our HTML document, this paragraph also contains a sample link! 
        This is a &lt;a href="sample2.html">Sample Link&lt;/a> example!
    &lt;/p>
 &lt;/body>
&lt;/html>
    </textarea>
     <p>You save the file on your computer, using either <em><b>.htm or .html</b></em> as the file extension (there is no difference).
      And set the encoding to <em><b>UTF-8</b> (Unicode)</em>, witch is the preferred encoding for HTML; it is also the default character set, if one is not specified otherwise.
      To view the HTML Page in your Browser, <i>double click</i> on the file, or right-click it and choose <i>"Open with"</i>.
     </p>
  </section>

  <section> <h2>Web Browsers</h2>
    <p>The purpose of a web browser (such as <i>Chrome, Edge, Firefox or Safari</i>) is to read HTML documents and display them correctly.
      A browser does not display the HTML tags, but uses them to determine how to display the document;
      then parse this markup, turning it into a <strong>DOM <em>(Document Object Model)</em> tree</strong>.
      A <em>DOM tree</em> is an in-memory representation of a document, the <strong>HTML DOM</strong> is an <strong>API <em>(Programming Interface)</em></strong> for <em><b>JavaScript</b></em>.
      DOM trees contain several kinds of <em><b>nodes</b></em>, in particular a <em>DocumentType node, Element nodes, Text nodes, Comment nodes, and in some cases Processing Instruction nodes</em>.
      Each element in the DOM tree is represented by an <em><b>object</b></em>, and these objects have APIs so that they can be manipulated from <em>scripts</em> in the page.
      <em><b>Scripts</b></em> (typically in <em>JavaScript</em>) are small programs that can be embedded using the <em>&lt;script></em> element or using <em>event handler content attributes</em>.
     </p>
    <h3>Inspect an HTML Element</h3>
     <p>To view <em>HTML Source Code</em>, Right-click in an HTML page and select <i>"View Page Source"</i> in Chrome or <i>"View Source"</i> in Edge (or similar methods in other browsers).
      Or to Inspect an <em>HTML Element</em>, Right-click on an element (or a blank area), and choose <i>"Inspect" or "Inspect Element"</i> to see what the elements are made up of.
      Doing any of these this will open a window containing the HTML source code of the page, you can then also edit the HTML on-the-fly in the <i>Elements panel</i> that opens.
     </p>
    <h3>Whitespace</h3>
     <p>With HTML, you cannot change the display by adding extra spaces or extra lines in your HTML code.
      The browser will automatically remove any extra spaces and lines when the page is displayed.
     </p>
  </section>

  <section> <h2>HTML Character Sets (Encoding)</h2>
     <p>To display an HTML page correctly, a web browser must know which character set to use, the encoding <em><b>UTF-8</b> (Unicode)</em>; is the default character set. 
      <strong>Unicode</strong> is a character set, and <em><b>UTF-8</b></em> is encoding; Unicode is a list of characters with unique decimal numbers (code points).
      Encoding is how these numbers are translated into binary numbers, to then be stored in a computer, UTF-8 encoding will store "hello" with binary.
      So the encoding translates numbers into binary, while the character set translates characters into numbers.
      <br />The character encoding for the early web was <em>ASCII</em>, to standardize storing of text, the <em><b>American Standard Code for Information Interchange</b> (ASCII)</em> was created.
      It defined a unique <em>binary number</em> for each storable character to support the <i>numbers from 0-9, the upper and lower case alphabet and special characters (like ! $ + - ( @ > , .)</i>.
      Computer data is stored as binary codes (01000101) in the electronics.
     </p>
     <p>The character set most often used in HTML 4 was <em><b>ISO-8859-1</b></em>, witch is an extension to ASCII, with added international characters.
      However, when a browser detects ISO-8859-1, it normally defaults to <em><b>Windows-1252</b></em>, because Windows-1252 has 32 more international characters.
      <br />The <strong>Unicode Consortium</strong> then developed the <em><b>UTF-8</b> and <b>UTF-16</b></em> standards, because the ISO-8859 character-sets are limited and not a compatible multilingual environment.
      The <em><b>Unicode Standard</b></em> covers almost all of the <i>characters, punctuations, and symbols</i> in the world;
      it has become a success, implemented in <i>HTML, XML, Java, JavaScript, E-mail, ASP, PHP, etc</i>.
      The Unicode standard is also supported in many operating systems and in all modern browsers.
      The Unicode Consortium cooperates with the leading standards development organizations, like <i>ISO, W3C and ECMA</i>.
     </p>
     <p>A character-set different from UTF-8 can be specified in the &lt;meta> tag: <code>&lt;meta <em>charset="ISO-8859-1"</em>></code>
      - HTML4 supports only the UTF-8 encoding, while HTML5 processors support both UTF-8, UTF-16 and the Windows-1252 or ISO-8859 character sets.
     </p>

     <h3>HTML Reserved Characters & Entities</h3>
     <p>Some characters are reserved in HTML, <em>Reserved Characters</em> must be replaced with <em><b>Character Entities</b></em>; witch is done using the entities name or number: <code>&entity_name; | &#entity_number;</code>
      <br/>If you use the less "<em><</em>" or greater than "<em>></em>" signs, the browser might mix them with tags;
      character entities are used to display thease characters.
      Another common use is the <em>non-breaking space</em>, it is to prevent browsers from truncating spaces in HTML pages.
      If you write 10 spaces in text, the browser will remove 9 of them, so to add spaces to the text, you can use a character entity.
      Browsers may not support all entity names, but the support for entity numbers is good.
     <table>    <caption> <b>Some Useful HTML Character Entities</b> </caption>
         <tr>   <th>Result</th> <th>Description</th> <th>Entity Name</th> <th>Entity Number</th>    </tr>
         <tr>   <td></td> <td>Non-breaking Space</td> <td>&amp;nbsp;</td> <td>&amp;#160;</td>   </tr>
         <tr>   <td><</td> <td>Less than</td> <td>&amp;lt;</td> <td>&amp;#60;</td>  </tr>
         <tr>   <td>></td> <td>Greater than</td> <td>&amp;gt;</td> <td>&amp;#62;</td>   </tr>
         <tr>   <td>&</td> <td>Ampersand</td> <td>&amp;amp;</td> <td>&amp;#38;</td> </tr>
         <tr>   <td>"</td> <td>Double Quotation-mark</td> <td>&amp;quot;</td> <td>&amp;#34;</td>    </tr>
         <tr>   <td>'</td> <td>Single Quotation-mark / Apostrophe)</td> <td>&amp;apos;</td> <td>&amp;#39;</td>  </tr>
     </table>

     </p>

    <h3>HTML Symbol Entities</h3>
     <p>HTML symbols like <i>mathematical operators, currency, arrows, technical symbols and shapes</i>, are not present on a normal keyboard;
      but can be added by using entities. To add such symbols to an HTML page, use the <em>entity name or entity number</em> for the symbol.
     <table>    <caption> <b>Some Useful HTML Symbol Entities</b>   </caption>
         <tr>   <th>Character</th> <th>Description</th> <th>Entity Name</th> <th>Entity Number</th> </tr>
         <tr>   <td>Δ</td> <td>Delta</td> <td>&amp;Delta;</td> <td>&amp;#916;</td>  </tr>
         <tr>   <td>€</td> <td>Euro</td> <td>&amp;euro;</td> <td>&amp;#163;</td>    </tr>
         <tr>   <td>¥</td> <td>Yen</td> <td>&amp;yen;</td> <td>&amp;#8364;</td> </tr>
         <tr>   <td>®</td> <td>Registered Trademark</td> <td>&amp;reg;</td> <td>&amp;#174;</td> </tr>
         <tr>   <td>→</td> <td>Rightwards Arrow</td> <td>&amp;rarr;</td> <td>&amp;#8594;</td>   </tr>
         <tr>   <td>♥</td> <td>Black Heart Suit</td> <td>&amp;hearts;</td> <td>&amp;#9829;</td> </tr>
     </table>
      <br/>See the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3schools.com/charsets/ref_utf_punctuation.asp">Complete HTML5 Symbols Reference</a>.
     </p>

    <h3>Emojis in HTML</h3>
     <p>Emojis look like <i>images or icons</i>, but are not; they are characters from the <em>UTF-8</em> character set.
      Many UTF-8 characters cannot be typed on keyboard, but displayed using numbers called entity numbers.
      To let the browser understand you are displaying a character, you must start the entity number with <em><b>&</b> and <b>#</b></em>, then end with a <em>semicolon (<b>;</b>)</em>. 
      Since Emojis are characters, they can be copied, displayed and sized just like any other character in HTML. 
     <table>    <caption> <b>Some Emoji Symbols in UTF-8</b> </caption>
         <tr>   <th>Emoji</th> <th>Value</th>   </tr>   
         <tr>   <td>🗻</td> <td>&amp;#128507;</td>   </tr>
         <tr>   <td>🗼</td> <td>&amp;#128508;</td>   </tr>
         <tr>   <td>🗽</td> <td>&amp;#128509;</td>   </tr>
         <tr>   <td>😀</td>  <td>&amp;#128512;</td>  </tr>
         <tr>   <td>😁</td>  <td>&amp;#128513;</td>  </tr>
         <tr>   <td>😂</td>  <td>&amp;#128514;</td>  </tr>
     </table>

     <h3>Uniform Resource Locator (URL) Encoding</h3>
      <p>A Uniform Resource Locator (URL) is used to address a document or other data on the web, it is another word for a web address; browsers request pages from web servers by using a URL.
      A URL can be composed of words like <i>w3schools.com</i>, or as an <em><b>Internet Protocol</b> (IP)</em> address like <i>192.68.20.50</i>.
      Most people, however, enter the name when surfing, because names are easier to remember than numbers.
      <br />URL encoding (or <em>Percent Encoding</em>) converts characters into a format that can be transmitted over the Internet, URLs can only be sent over the Internet using the <em>ASCII</em> character-set.
      Since URLs often contain characters outside the ASCII set, the URL has to be converted into a valid ASCII format.
      The URL encoding replaces unsafe ASCII characters with a "<b>%</b>" followed by two hexadecimal digits.
      URLs cannot contain spaces, URL encoding normally replaces a space with a plus (<b>+</b>) sign or with <em><b>%20</b></em>.
      </p>
      <p>A web address such as <i>https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp</i> follows these syntax rules: <samp>scheme://prefix.domain:port/path/filename</samp>
       <ul>
          <li><strong>scheme</strong> - Defines the type of Internet service, the most common is <em>http or https</em>.
           <table>  <caption>This table lists some common schemes:</caption>
              <tr>  <th>Scheme</th> <th>Used for</th>   </tr>
              <tr>  <td>http - HyperText Transfer Protocol</td> <td>Common web pages - Is not encrypted</td> </tr>
              <tr>  <td>https - Secure HyperText Transfer Protocol</td> <td>Secure web pages - Is encrypted</td> </tr>
              <tr>  <td>ftp - File Transfer Protocol</td> <td>Downloading or uploading files</td> </tr>
              <tr>  <td>file</td> <td>A file on your computer</td> </tr>
           </table>
          </li>
          <li><strong>prefix</strong> - Defines a domain prefix, the default for http is www</li>
          <li><strong>domain</strong> - Defines the Internet domain name, such as <i>w3schools.com</i></li>
          <li><strong>port</strong> - Defines the port number at the host, the default for http is 80</li>
          <li><strong>path</strong> - Defines a path at the server, and if omitted, the root directory of the site</li>
          <li><strong>filename</strong> - Defines the name of a document or resource</li>
       </ul>
      </p>
    <h4>Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP)</h4>
     <p>The World Wide Web (WWW) is about communication between web clients and servers, this is done by sending <em>HTTP Requests</em> and receiving <em>HTTP Responses</em>.
      Clients are often browsers (<i>Chrome, Edge, Safari</i>), but they can be any type of program or device, Servers are most often computers in the cloud.
      <br />The communication is done by request and response methods, shown below (read more on
      <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_httpmethods.asp">HTTP Methods</a>):
       <ol>
           <li>A client (a browser) sends an HTTP request to the web</li>
           <li>A web server receives the request</li>
           <li>The server runs an application to process the request</li>
           <li>The server returns an HTTP response (the output) to the browser</li>
           <li>The client (the browser) receives the response</li>
       </ol>
      <strong>HTTP Status Messages</strong> - The server always returns a message for every request, these messages are called <em>HTTP Status Messages</em> (See a list of
      <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_httpmessages.asp">HTTP Status Messages</a> that might be returned).
      When a browser requests from a web server, an error may also occur and the server might return an error code like "<i>404 Not Found</i>";
      it's common to name these <em>HTML error messages</em>.

    <p> <strong>Note:</strong> In particular, familiarity with the basics of <strong>DOM</strong> is necessary for a complete understanding of some of the more technical parts.
      An understanding of <em>Web IDL, HTTP, XML, Unicode, character encodings, JavaScript and CSS</em> will also be helpful in places but is not essential.
